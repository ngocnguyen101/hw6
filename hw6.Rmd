>__Question__1: Data cleaning: the values “IAP”, “DK” and “NA” all encode missing values. Replace all of these instances by the value NA.

```{r}

#happy[happy == "NA"] = NA
#happy[happy == "DK"] = NA
happy = replace(happy, happy =="IAP", NA)
happy = replace(happy, happy =="NA", NA)
happy = replace(happy, happy =="DK", NA)
